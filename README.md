**AI-Powered Early Detection of Sepsis Using Real-Time Patient Data**

Project Objective:

Develop an AI model that predicts the onset of sepsis in hospitalized patients before clinical symptoms become severe. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the bodyâ€™s response to infection, and early detection can save lives.

**Why This Project?**



1.   Sepsis is deadly: It accounts for 1 in 3 hospital deaths.
2.   Early detection can reduce mortality rates significantly.
3.   ML can help by identifying hidden patterns in patient vitals that doctors might miss.

Approach:
1. Data Collection: Using MIMIC III dataset (BIGQUERY)
2. Data processing:
  *   Handling Missing values (imputation using KNN)
  *   Feature Engineering
      * Time series trends Vital Signs
      * Lab results changes over time
      * Patient age, or pre-existing conditions.
  *   Normalize Data (For Standardizing data)
3. Model Development & Training:
    Basic or baseline Models
    * Random Forest / XGBoost to classification
    * Logistic Regression for explainability
    Deep Learning Approach
    * LSTM / GRU (for time-series patient vitals)
	  * Transformer-based models (e.g., Time-Series BERT) for sequence modeling
	  * Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for relationships between patient parameters
4. Model Evaluation
  * Performance Metrics:
	    * Precision, Recall, F1-Score (since false negatives are critical)
	    * AUROC (Area Under ROC Curve) for model discrimination
	* Explainability
	    * Use SHAP or LIME to explain AI decisions to doctors.
